# Animate Hand Writing

`vite.js` vanilla javascript application with the code to emulate hand writing.  
The code used in this mini application was the support for the article [Animate Hand Writing](https://www.lorismat.com/blog/emulate-hand-writing) of my blog.  

In the `main.js` file is the code to run the page, including the `HTML` string and the `anime.js` library.
