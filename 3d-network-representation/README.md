# Representing a Network in 3D 

[Blog Post](https://www.lorismat.com/blog/3d-network-representation) and [Original Project](https://net-sim.netlify.app/).  

The code for this project can be found in another repository, open for contribution: [snap-3d-network](https://github.com/lorismat/snap-3d-network). It includes the `python` script to convert a network to a json file ready to be visualized with `Three.js` or any other 3D library.
